# SVPWM-TEENSY
This code implements Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) for a 3-phase inverter using a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller and the eFlexPWM library. SVPWM is a sophisticated technique used to generate 3-phase sinusoidal voltages for motor control applications, offering better utilization of the DC bus voltage and reduced harmonic distortion.
